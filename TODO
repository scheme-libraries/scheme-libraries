* Add debug and info to composite library.
* Raise an error if exported variable is set!.
* Check whether enough labels are killed.
* Implement fluid-let.
* Use global labels for constants to reduce closure sizes

* At the moment, the literal returned by stdlibs-collection->datum
  seems to be only used as an argument to datum->library-collection.
  This leads the JIT compiler to be invoked on demand.  Maybe it is
  more useful to let the stdlibs-collection macro expand into code
  that actually creates the library collection.
